			"The more you sweat in practice, the less you bleed in battle.",
			"I wanted to have a career in sports when I was young, but I had to give it up. I'm only six feet tall, so I couldn't play basketball. I'm only 190 pounds, so I couldn't play football. And I have 20-20 vision, so I couldn't be a referee.",
			"Playing polo is like trying to play golf during an earthquake.",
			"The breakfast of champions is not cereal, it's the opposition.",
			"I figure practice puts your brains in your muscles.",
			"An athlete cannot run with money in his pockets. He must run with hope in his heart and dreams in his head.",
			"In play there are two pleasures for your choosing. One is winning, and the other losing.",
			"All sports are games of inches.",
			"Most people give up just when they're about to achieve success. They quit on the one yard line. They give up at the last minute of the game, one foot from a winning touchdown.",
